srvdir server the current directory via HTTP.

Example of use:

    % ls
    index.html
    post.html
    style.css
    % srvdir -http=:8080

This will serve the files index.html, post.html and style.css in the port 8080,
so you can point your browser to the url http://localhost:8080/post.html and see
the post.html file contents.

It's similar to Python's SimpleHTTPServer, but faster.

Some very basic ab statistics:

Python's SimpleHTTPServer:

    % ab -c 10 -n 5000 http://localhost:8000/post.html
    ...
    Requests per second:    1168.66 [#/sec] (mean)
    Time per request:       8.557 [ms] (mean)
    Time per request:       0.856 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
    Transfer rate:          5419.88 [Kbytes/sec] received

srvdir:

    % ab -c 10 -n 5000 http://localhost:9090/post.html
    ...
    Requests per second:    4095.31 [#/sec] (mean)
    Time per request:       2.442 [ms] (mean)
    Time per request:       0.244 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
